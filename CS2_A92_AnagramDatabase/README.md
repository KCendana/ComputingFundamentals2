# Summary

For this assignment, I had to..
- Implement a class called LetterInventory that kept track of the letters used in strings.
  - Some functions included: Constructor, IsEmpty, Show, Insert, Remove, CanRemove
- I also had to find all possible anagrams of a user given string that could be found in a text file.
  - I was given three text files: small.txt, medium.txt, and large.txt, each with varying amounts of words from the dictionary.
  - The entire process had to be done using recursion.
